/**
 * BindingAccumulator — read-append-only accumulator that collects TypeEnv
 * bindings across all files in the GitNexus analyzer pipeline.
 *
 * **Quality asymmetry between execution paths (PR #743 review):** Entries in
 * this accumulator are NOT homogeneous in resolution quality. The pipeline
 * feeds bindings through two paths:
 *
 * - **Sequential path** (`call-processor.ts` → `typeEnv.flush()`): files
 *   processed on the main thread have access to the full `SymbolTable` and
 *   `importedBindings` at build time, so their bindings benefit from Tier 2
 *   cross-file propagation (e.g. an imported constructor's return type
 *   flows into the variable binding).
 *
 * - **Worker path** (`parse-worker.ts` → IPC tuple → pipeline adapter): files
 *   processed in worker threads run without the main-thread `SymbolTable`
 *   and without `importedBindings`, so they can only produce Tier 0
 *   (annotation-declared) and local Tier 1 (same-file constructor
 *   inference) bindings. Cross-file type flow is not visible to the worker.
 *
 * Implication: Phase 9 consumers that trust every accumulator entry equally
 * will silently produce worse results for large repos (worker path dominates)
 * than for small ones (sequential path dominates). The asymmetry is
 * structural — workers cannot see the SymbolTable without either shipping a
 * copy over IPC or synchronizing after parse. If Phase 9 needs homogeneous
 * quality, it should either (a) tag entries with their tier at insert time
 * so consumers can filter, or (b) post-process worker-path entries through a
 * follow-up resolution pass once the main-thread SymbolTable is complete.
 *
 * **PR #743 review — IPC narrowing:** The worker path currently only
 * serializes file-scope (`scope = ''`) entries through the IPC boundary.
 * Function-scope bindings are stripped at `parse-worker.ts` to avoid paying
 * a ~4.9 MB live memory cost for data that has no current consumer. The
 * sequential path's `flush()` still writes all scopes (file-scope and
 * function-scope). See `FileAllScopeBindings` JSDoc in `parse-worker.ts`
 * for the Phase 9 reversion path.
